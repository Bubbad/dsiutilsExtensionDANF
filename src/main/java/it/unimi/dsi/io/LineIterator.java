/** An adapter that exposes a fast buffered reader as an iterator
 * over the returned lines. Since we just actually read a line to know
 * whether {@link #hasNext()} should return true, the last line read
 * from the underlying fast buffered reader has to be cached.
 * Mixing calls to this adapter and to the underlying fast buffered
 * reader will not usually give the expected results.
 * 
 * <p>Since this class allocates no resource, it is not {@link Closeable} and
 * it will not close the underlying {@link FastBufferedReader} under any circumstances.
 * If you need resource handling, try {@link FileLinesCollection}. 
 * 
 * <p>This class reuses the same mutable strings. As a result,
 * the comments for {@link FileLinesCollection}
 * apply here. If you want just get all the remaining lines, use {@link #allLines()}.
