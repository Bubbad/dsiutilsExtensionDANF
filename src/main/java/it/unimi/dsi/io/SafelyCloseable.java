import java.io.Closeable;

/** A marker interface for a closeable resource that implements safety measures to
 * make resource tracking easier.
 * 
 * <p>Classes implementing this interface must provide a <em>safety-net finaliser</em>&mdash;a
 * finaliser that closes the resource and logs that resource should have been closed.
 * 
 * <p>When the implementing class is abstract, concrete subclasses <strong>must</strong>
 * call <code>super.close()</code> in their own {@link java.io.Closeable#close()} method
 * to let the abstract class track correctly the resource. Moreover, 
 * they <strong>must</strong> run <code>super.finalize()</code> in
 * their own finaliser (if any), as finalisation chaining is not automatic.
 * 
 * <p>Note that if a concrete subclass implements <code>readResolve()</code>, it must
 * call <code>super.close()</code>, or actually return <code>this</code> (i.e., the deserialised
 * instance); otherwise, a spurious log could be generated when the deserialised instance is collected.
