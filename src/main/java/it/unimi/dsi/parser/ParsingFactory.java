/** A set of coherent methods to turn element-type, attribute and entity names to unique interned instances.
 * 
 * <p>The {@link it.unimi.dsi.parser.BulletParser} needs a way to turn
 * a name (for an element type, attribute, or entity) into a corresponding object
 * of type {@link it.unimi.dsi.parser.Element}, {@link it.unimi.dsi.parser.Attribute}
 * or {@link it.unimi.dsi.parser.Entity}, respectively. The returned element must
 * be an interned, unique representation. 
 * 
 * <P>For instance, the {@linkplain it.unimi.dsi.parser.HTMLFactory standard factory for
 * HTML} parsing has ready-made interned versions of all names in the (X)HTML specification,
 * and returns them upon request, but other policies are possible. For instance, instances of 
 * {@link WellFormedXmlFactory} intern every seen name, without reference to a data type (except
 * for entities, in which case the HTML set is used).
 * 
 * <P>The idea of factoring out the creation of interned counterparts of
 * SGML/XML syntactical objects is due to Fabien Campagne.
