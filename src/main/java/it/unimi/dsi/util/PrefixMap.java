/** A map from prefixes to string intervals (and possibly <i>vice versa</i>).
 * 
 * <p>Instances of this class provide the services of a {@link StringMap}, but by assuming
 * the strings are lexicographically ordered, they can provide further information by
 * exposing a {@linkplain #rangeMap() function from string prefixes to intervals} and a
 * {@linkplain #prefixMap() function from intervals to string prefixes}.
 * 
 * <p>In the first case, given a prefix, we can ask for the range of strings starting
 * with that prefix, expressed as an {@link Interval}. This information is very useful to 
 * satisfy prefix queries (e.g., <code>monitor*</code>) with a brute-force approach.
 * 
 * <P>Optionally, a prefix map may provide the opposite service: given an interval of terms, it
 *  may provide the maximum common prefix. This feature can be checked for by calling 
 *  {@link #prefixMap()}.
