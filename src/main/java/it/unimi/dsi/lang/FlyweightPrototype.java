/** A prototype providing flyweight copies.
 * 
 * <p><em>Flyweight copies</em> are useful to implement multithreading on read-only
 * (but maybe stateful) classes. An instance of a class implementing this interface 
 * is not necessarily thread safe,
 * but it can be (thread-) safely copied many times (i.e., it can be used as a prototype). 
 * All copies will share as much as possible of the class read-only
 * state (so they are flyweight).
 * 
 * <p>In the case an implementation is stateless, it can of course return always the same singleton
 * instance as a copy. At the other extreme, a stateful class may decide to synchronise its
 * methods and return itself as a copy instead. Note that in general the object returned
 * by {@link #copy()} must replicate the <em>current state</em> of the object, not
 * the object state at creation time. This might require some calls to methods that
 * modify the class internal state: in particular, one should always check whether such
 * methods are pointed out in the documentation of superclasses.
 * 
 * <p><strong>Warning</strong>: if {@link #copy()} accesses mutable internal state, setters
 * and {@link #copy()} must be suitably synchronised.
 * 
 * <p>Implementing subclasses are invited to use covariant return-type overriding to
 * make {@link #copy()} return the right type.
